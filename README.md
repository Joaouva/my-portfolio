<h1>Hello there!</h1>

So finally here it is, my personal website!

It is a single page using React with a huge amount of <span>ðŸ’š</span> and styles.
The page it's fully responsive and I've add some sytles using CSS modules and NPM modules. 


New updates I'm currently working on:
<ul>
<li> Contact form with backend integration </li>
<li> Dark/light theme switch </li> - DONE!
<li> Some style I would like to change </li> - DONE!
</ul>

Fell more than free to give feedback, it will help me <span>ðŸ˜Ž</span>
